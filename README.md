## Description
* YumTown is an web application that can be used to search recipes by dish or ingredient name. Upon searching it returns upto 12 recipes cards 
that includes the image, name, and time it would take to make each recipe. You can double-click on one of the recipe cards to view details of
that recipe including ingredients, instructions, and a pricebreakdown.You can create an account and login.
* We used spoonacular API to get recipes and the price breakdown widget. Initially we started by using the yummly API but it didn't have a lot of functionalities that we wanted to achieve for our web app. This included returning detail recipe steps and price breakdown based on ingredient. Yummly, big oven, and many other APIs we initially worked required us to have an ID for each ingredient and then do the mmath based on quantity needed. Spoonacular has a great widget that can be accessed by a simple API ajax POST request that includes a table and chart view that tells us the price breakdown.
